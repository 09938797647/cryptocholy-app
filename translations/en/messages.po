And so do other players.\n\nWill you get the coins?\nOr nothing?\nLet's see.\n\nThe rules are simple: you need to accumulate the required sum of points to withdraw them into Notcoin. Each round, you are offered to take the entire sum for yourself or split it in half with your opponent. If both choose to take, no one gets anything. If one chooses to take and the other to split, the first one takes it all. If both choose to split, both get an equal share.\n\nTo motivate you a bit more, remember that when you lose, you start the game with 0 points ✨"
